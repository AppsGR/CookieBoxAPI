More than a generation after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.\nI put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it An Awakening Mind. This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious."

John Piper finished his devotions, slid on his boots, bundled in his coat, and stepped outside to the remnants of an overnight ice storm to walk 600 slippery steps from his Minneapolis home to the door of Bethlehem Baptist Church for the weekly prayer gathering. The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance."
