More than a generation after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.\nI put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it An Awakening Mind. This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious."

John Piper finished his devotions, slid on his boots, bundled in his coat, and stepped outside to the remnants of an overnight ice storm to walk 600 slippery steps from his Minneapolis home to the door of Bethlehem Baptist Church for the weekly prayer gathering. The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance."

I have spent this afternoon listening to him as he read his poems and sang hymns with me. I recorded these little duets three years before he died. It has been a sweet afternoon.\nI wish I had felt at 17 what I feel at 67. I wish I had known and felt the value of a father’s Song. I wish I had sung with him earlier, just the two of us. Perhaps some young son reading this will ask the Lord Jesus to take away the immature embarrassment at his father’s Song—the Song of his life.\nMy father was an evangelist-poet-singer-songwriter. I have in front of me a folder with the lyrics and the musical scores that he wrote. Five of these are the actual pre-lined music paper where he drew in the notes and printed by hand the lyrics between the treble and bass clefs.\nThere are titles like “I’m in Debt to Jesus,” “Christ Is the Answer,” “Thy Hand upon Me, Lord,” “Take Time to Pray,” and “Lord, Make Me Pure.” One, called “His Grace Is Sufficient,” is printed with the words “Copyright, 1943, by William S. H. Piper” in the bottom margin.\nI have written before that my father was the happiest man I ever knew. One of the reasons for this was his singing faith. To feel the significance of this, you need to understand that he was a fundamentalist. That’s not a bad word in my vocabulary. And he’s the reason. Fundamentals are worth dying for and fighting for. But that fight has killed the Song in the hearts of many people. But not in Bill Piper."

In this case, Jonathan Parnell did most of the heavy lifting, but my gratitude overflows to all. They conceived of this collection and, along with Justin Taylor’s gracious contributions, made it a reality. All I did was help title the chapters and write this preface. They gathered my thoughts from many sources and put them together here.\nWhen I look back over the years covered by this collection, I realize with fresh intensity the pervasive impact on me of Edwards’s vision of God. Without Edwards, I am not sure the phrase “God-entranced” would have the meaning for me it does. This is an indictment of my soul. For someone should ask, Isn’t the Bible enough to make you God-entranced? The true answer is that it should be."

Everyone must get up and walk through the routines of making breakfast, and washing clothes, and going to work, and paying bills, and discipling children. We must, in general, keep life going when the heart is breaking.\nBut it’s different with pastors—not totally different, but different. The heart is the instrument of our vocation. Charles Spurgeon said, “Ours is more than mental work—it is heart work, the labour of our inmost soul.”1 When a pastor’s heart is breaking, therefore, he must labor with a broken instrument. Preaching is the pastor’s main work, and preaching is heart work, not just mental work. The question becomes, then, not just how you keep living when the marriage is blank, or when the finances don’t reach, or when the pews are bare and friends forsake you; but, How do you keep preaching?"

They affect joints, bones, nervous systems, lungs, hearts, and brains. And even in the United States—a country that leads the world in medical innovation and technology—roughly 20% of its citizens live with a disability.\nNo church is immune, so every church leader must be prepared. Disability raises some of the most fundamental questions about the goodness and sovereignty of God a pastor will ever face. And often these questions are raised by people experiencing significant suffering.\nDoes God have a good design in my disability?\nTo this hard question God is not silent. But for us to hear from him requires that we submit our hearts to his word to learn from him. And that is the aim of this collection of sermons and interviews from the ministry of John Piper.\nThis short ebook opens with the story of Jesus healing the blind man in John 9. It is a story relevant for those who have been healed. And it is equally valuable for those who will not be healed of their disability in this lifetime. John 9 is foundational for the rest of the ebook.\nThe two chapters that follow are unedited sermon manuscripts from the preaching ministry of John Piper. In the first, “Why Was This Child Born Blind?,” Pastor John makes the important distinction between the cause and purpose of disability. Like the disciples, we are too easily absorbed with questions of what causes disability and less focused on the purposes of God in the disability, and this fundamental flaw distracts us from God’s ultimate, sovereign, and good design. Ultimately all disabilities exist to point us to Christ, who willingly suffered so that one day all the suffering related to disability will be erased from the joints and cells and brains of God’s children."
