John Piper finished his devotions, slid on his boots, bundled in his coat, and stepped outside to the remnants of an overnight ice storm to walk 600 slippery steps from his Minneapolis home to the door of Bethlehem Baptist Church for the weekly prayer gathering. The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance."

More than a generation after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.\nI put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it An Awakening Mind. This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious."

Skillful listening is a non-negotiable skill for everyone who enters a church building on Sunday or plays a sermon through headphones during the week. \n\nThe life and health and growth of our souls are tied to how well we listen. We are wise to periodically evaluate our own hearing of God’s word. If we listen with carelessness, we can drift away from God. On the other hand, if we listen with vigilance we “swim against the stream of sin and indifference.” \n\n\n“Don’t be cavalier in the hearing of God’s Word week after week,” John Piper cautions us. “If it is not softening and saving and healing and bearing fruit, it is probably hardening and blinding and dulling.” It is too easy to slip into what Scripture calls “dullness of hearing,” to hear the weekly sermons without faith, and to see little or no moral fruit in our lives as a result. As Jesus makes clear, ultimately it is how we hear that reveals who we are (John 8:43, 47, 10:4, 27). \n\n\nThose are a few of the points made in this e-book, which is comprised of five unedited sermon manuscripts from the preaching ministry of Pastor John Piper at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This selection covers a span of fourteen years (the earliest sermon was taken from 1984, the latest from 1998). The five selected manuscripts are published here as they existed when the sermons were preached. There is little doubt that Pastor John would prefer to rework these manuscripts stylistically and even structurally in a number of ways to make them more suitable for reading. Yet we believe these sermon manuscripts in their present state of development are sufficiently clear to benefit our readership now. Where explanation is necessary, footnotes have been added. We pray this resource will serve your personal reflection as you heed Jesus’ command to “take care how you listen.”"

The issue hit newsstands and re-ignited a longstanding mommy war in American culture. We were ready to respond from a Christian perspective at desiringGod.org—but only barely.\nTen months earlier ( July 2011), when our blog was just beginning to take shape and we had no regular female contributors, writer and mother of six, Rachel Jankovic (Idaho), wrote and emailed a submission to us in a Word doc. We pasted it into a blog post, gave it a simple title—“Motherhood Is a Calling (And Where Your Children Rank)”—and hit publish. We simply posted the text and added no image, no color, no visual flair. Despite its minimalism, the post spread virally immediately, and the initial momentum swelled for months. A full three years later, the post has been ‘liked’ on Facebook over 100,000 times and viewed over 500,000 times, both records for anything published on the Desiring God blog. The post now averages 180 visits every day.\nRachel’s post awoke us to the segment of DG blog readers who are wives and mothers eager to apply the gospel to their hearts and homes. Sensing the need, in February of 2012 I wrote in my journal a short prayer: “We need more ‘mommy bloggers’ who can write, who have time to write, and, most importantly, who understand the gospel, joy, and Christian Hedonism, and who are skilled to apply all this to their own hearts in the context of the home and the pressures of motherhood.” It was a prayer echoed verbally many times by the content team here at DG. In the meantime, Rachel was kind enough to continue writing for us. As a team we began reading mommy blogs, gathering leads, and sending requests.\nIn March 2012, we received our first posts from Rachel Pieh Jones (Djibouti) and Christine Hoover (Virginia). The next month we added to the mix Gloria Furman (Dubai) and Trillia Newbell (Tennessee). In June we published a post from Rebekah Merkle (Idaho). In 2013 we began receiving posts from Christina Fox (Florida) and Stacy Reaoch (Pennsylvania).\nWithout intending it, this geographically diverse group of women created a unique, global perspective on biblical femininity. Spread across the country and across the world, these ladies shared one calling: seeking to live fruitfully and faithfully as daughters of God, wives, and moms.\nThe two-year span between March 2012 and March 2014 brackets a golden age of blog publishing for us. These writers combined to publish 89 posts, mostly under the banner: “Grace at Home.” They addressed themes like the mother’s struggle with anxiety, the crucial value of prayer, treasuring children, the challenges of perfectionism, the lies of feminism, the loss of promising careers, dependence on God, and the ugly pride behind mommy wars.\nChristian mothers today find themselves pitched in a battle that will not end until Christ returns, so DG’s female contributors continue to play an essential role in our online voice. But we have found a place more naturally integrated into the overall flow of our content. This spring we retired the “Grace at Home” label, and now look back on it as a banner over God’s overwhelmingly gracious answer to our prayers.\nMom Enough is a compilation of the most popular pieces from this golden age, here published in chronological order. As you will see, the aim of Mom Enough is not to boost a mother’s self-sufficiency, but to build her fearlessness as she finds her sufficiency outside of herself (1 Pet. 3:1–6). This paradox is the secret power of godly mothers. Becoming mom enough comes as a result of answering the question, “Are you mom enough?,” with a firm no.\nWe begin with the blog post from Rachel Jankovic that started it all."

This is the starting place for any serious topical focus: to have the view of his greatness before us and to be swallowed up by it. The LORD — the triune God whose essence we can't divide and whose persons we can't blend. He is utterly independent, gloriously sovereign, never arbitrary. This is precisely the reason we exist, that we might enjoy him, to his glory. And that’s why sanctification matters.\nGod has designed that the salvation of his people not only involve his unconditional election and Jesus's redemptive triumph, but also the perfecting work of his Spirit — a work that seeps down into the nitty-gritty of our lives and wields the gospel's victory one swing at a time.\nThis is high-voltage power we're talking about. Power that we find in looking back and in looking forward. John Piper writes, \"The only sin that we can defeat is a forgiven sin.\" A forgiven sin is something we see in light of the cross (past event) where Jesus bore the wrath we deserved and kicked the teeth out of our guilt. This fuels the sin- conquering power needed now, in the present. But we also look forward, to the future. The past work of Christ secures the life and joy of our future with Christ. It's set. Done. And this also fuels the power needed now, in the present. Piper writes, \"Sin can't enslave a person who is utterly confident and sure and hope-filled in the infinite happiness of life with Christ in the future.\"\nIn God's wisdom, he spans every tense: the past work of Jesus outside of us and the future promise of Jesus for us collide in the present to empower our wills to kill sin. To grow in grace. To be sanctified. This e-book includes three sermons by Pastor John Piper that get at the heart of this in such texts as Philippians 2:12–13 and Romans 6:5–10. There is also a more practical appendix of some acronyms that Pastor John has taught over his 30-plus-year preaching ministry. Whether fighting a specific sin or walking by faith amid stressful circumstances, the aim of this e-book is to add to your arsenal for the everyday work of sanctification, for the glory of God."

In Isaiah’s Servant Songs we read that “his delight is in the fear of the Lord” Isa 11:6\n  \n“Isa 11:1-5 “ The Spirit will give penetrating diagnosis in “David’s” ministry – wisdom and discernment; the Spirit will enable him to give correct advice and the know-how or ability to carry it out; the Spirit will above all produce in “David” the knowledge of the fear of Yahweh. It will be his supreme delight to fear Yahweh – that is, to enter into that relation of absolute dependence on Yahweh which receives reciprocally a fellowship with Yahweh, sharing together in love and united purposes”. Dr E G Gibson (The Spirit and the Eschaton in O.T.)"

More than a generation after his death, Lewis’s works are now more popular and widely read than at any point during his lifetime.1 His thought is so creative and so profound and so extensive that Alister McGrath says, Half a century after his death, the process of receiving and interpreting Lewis has still only begun.\nI put Lewis in the top three writers who have influenced how I read and respond to the world. Yes, the world is a book to be read. And few people could read like Lewis. When Clyde Kilby wrote an anthology of Lewis’s writings he titled it A Mind Awake. He might have called it An Awakening Mind. This is the effect it has. His alertness to reality is contagious."

The gatherings were typically small, sometimes only three or four attended, but two or three is enough of an audience to pray for the congregation’s needs and the gospel’s advance."

Skillful listening is a non-negotiable skill for everyone who enters a church building on Sunday or plays a sermon through headphones during the week. \n\nThe life and health and growth of our souls are tied to how well we listen. We are wise to periodically evaluate our own hearing of God’s word. If we listen with carelessness, we can drift away from God. On the other hand, if we listen with vigilance we “swim against the stream of sin and indifference.” \n\n\n“Don’t be cavalier in the hearing of God’s Word week after week,” John Piper cautions us. “If it is not softening and saving and healing and bearing fruit, it is probably hardening and blinding and dulling.” It is too easy to slip into what Scripture calls “dullness of hearing,” to hear the weekly sermons without faith, and to see little or no moral fruit in our lives as a result. As Jesus makes clear, ultimately it is how we hear that reveals who we are (John 8:43, 47, 10:4, 27). \n\n\nThose are a few of the points made in this e-book, which is comprised of five unedited sermon manuscripts from the preaching ministry of Pastor John Piper at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This selection covers a span of fourteen years (the earliest sermon was taken from 1984, the latest from 1998). The five selected manuscripts are published here as they existed when the sermons were preached. There is little doubt that Pastor John would prefer to rework these manuscripts stylistically and even structurally in a number of ways to make them more suitable for reading. Yet we believe these sermon manuscripts in their present state of development are sufficiently clear to benefit our readership now. Where explanation is necessary, footnotes have been added. We pray this resource will serve your personal reflection as you heed Jesus’ command to “take care how you listen.”"

I have spent this afternoon listening to him as he read his poems and sang hymns with me. I recorded these little duets three years before he died. It has been a sweet afternoon.\nI wish I had felt at 17 what I feel at 67. I wish I had known and felt the value of a father’s Song. I wish I had sung with him earlier, just the two of us. Perhaps some young son reading this will ask the Lord Jesus to take away the immature embarrassment at his father’s Song—the Song of his life.\nMy father was an evangelist-poet-singer-songwriter. I have in front of me a folder with the lyrics and the musical scores that he wrote. Five of these are the actual pre-lined music paper where he drew in the notes and printed by hand the lyrics between the treble and bass clefs.\nThere are titles like “I’m in Debt to Jesus,” “Christ Is the Answer,” “Thy Hand upon Me, Lord,” “Take Time to Pray,” and “Lord, Make Me Pure.” One, called “His Grace Is Sufficient,” is printed with the words “Copyright, 1943, by William S. H. Piper” in the bottom margin.\nI have written before that my father was the happiest man I ever knew. One of the reasons for this was his singing faith. To feel the significance of this, you need to understand that he was a fundamentalist. That’s not a bad word in my vocabulary. And he’s the reason. Fundamentals are worth dying for and fighting for. But that fight has killed the Song in the hearts of many people. But not in Bill Piper."

In this case, Jonathan Parnell did most of the heavy lifting, but my gratitude overflows to all. They conceived of this collection and, along with Justin Taylor’s gracious contributions, made it a reality. All I did was help title the chapters and write this preface. They gathered my thoughts from many sources and put them together here.\nWhen I look back over the years covered by this collection, I realize with fresh intensity the pervasive impact on me of Edwards’s vision of God. Without Edwards, I am not sure the phrase “God-entranced” would have the meaning for me it does. This is an indictment of my soul. For someone should ask, Isn’t the Bible enough to make you God-entranced? The true answer is that it should be."

Everyone must get up and walk through the routines of making breakfast, and washing clothes, and going to work, and paying bills, and discipling children. We must, in general, keep life going when the heart is breaking.\nBut it’s different with pastors—not totally different, but different. The heart is the instrument of our vocation. Charles Spurgeon said, “Ours is more than mental work—it is heart work, the labour of our inmost soul.”1 When a pastor’s heart is breaking, therefore, he must labor with a broken instrument. Preaching is the pastor’s main work, and preaching is heart work, not just mental work. The question becomes, then, not just how you keep living when the marriage is blank, or when the finances don’t reach, or when the pews are bare and friends forsake you; but, How do you keep preaching?"

They affect joints, bones, nervous systems, lungs, hearts, and brains. And even in the United States—a country that leads the world in medical innovation and technology—roughly 20% of its citizens live with a disability.\nNo church is immune, so every church leader must be prepared. Disability raises some of the most fundamental questions about the goodness and sovereignty of God a pastor will ever face. And often these questions are raised by people experiencing significant suffering.\nDoes God have a good design in my disability?\nTo this hard question God is not silent. But for us to hear from him requires that we submit our hearts to his word to learn from him. And that is the aim of this collection of sermons and interviews from the ministry of John Piper.\nThis short ebook opens with the story of Jesus healing the blind man in John 9. It is a story relevant for those who have been healed. And it is equally valuable for those who will not be healed of their disability in this lifetime. John 9 is foundational for the rest of the ebook.\nThe two chapters that follow are unedited sermon manuscripts from the preaching ministry of John Piper. In the first, “Why Was This Child Born Blind?,” Pastor John makes the important distinction between the cause and purpose of disability. Like the disciples, we are too easily absorbed with questions of what causes disability and less focused on the purposes of God in the disability, and this fundamental flaw distracts us from God’s ultimate, sovereign, and good design. Ultimately all disabilities exist to point us to Christ, who willingly suffered so that one day all the suffering related to disability will be erased from the joints and cells and brains of God’s children."

She’d walked out many times before, but this was different. The abandonment, the adultery, and the deception had mounted a massive assault on their marriage and family. Had it been three men in just six months? He feared there were more. Again and again, she’d wrecked the family’s affairs with her own. She had spent and overspent the family budget to please another guy—another illicit, irrational, imaginary love.\nTheir marriage, once sweet, had become a nightmare. Those first days, maybe even months, of marital bliss felt so distant and unfamiliar. It was hard for her husband to believe they were ever even real. Two children—a son and a daughter—were the real victims, loved by dad, but left by mom. They were conceived and raised in despair and misery. Their dad had always hoped things would change. He even promised that things would be different, that the loneliness and betrayal they’d known their whole lives would be turned for good—for hope, belonging, and love.\nNot knowing what to say to his confused and wounded children that night, dad knelt down between their beds, and he prayed:\nGod, please rescue my bride—the mother of my precious children—from this destructive, suicidal path. She’s left us for other lovers, believing that with them she’ll find the protection and affection she craves. For as long as she runs from the promises we made and the family we’ve built together, graciously cause her to be unsatisfied, empty, and lonely. Maybe then, in her despair and need, she will remember us, return to our family, and be Wife and Mom again. If she would only come home, I would welcome her into my arms and heart as if it were our wedding day. I would love her as if we never lost her. Bring her home, for the sake of your Name, Amen. (Hosea 2:5–7)\nSeveral years later, on a hot afternoon in August, the husband was walking downtown through a local park. His oldest, a teenager now, had left an assignment on the kitchen table, so he was dropping it off at school. He could walk from his office, and usually even enjoyed the break and exercise, but it was uncomfortable today. Temperatures had soared to record highs, leaving most people hiding inside until evening. He saw a woman, though—the only soul he’d seen since he left work. She was exhausted, disheveled, and desperate. She was squeezing every last drop out of a public drinking fountain, clinging to it like she might drown if she let go. As he walked closer, he started to make out her face.\n“Hannah? . . . is that you?” He looked into her eyes and saw the face he knew so well, the woman who had hurt him so deeply. She was still his wife. She looked around uncomfortably, as if she was waiting for someone else to walk by and discover her shame. She had left so much for so very little. She left the provision, safety, and intimacy of a truly good man for a treadmill of temporary pleasure and terrible, destructive life choices. The other men always seemed so attractive, but they never truly loved her, and the relationships never lasted."

This string of days provides an annual interval for us to focus intently on the greatest events in human history, the acts of our Savior Jesus Christ. “Fix your gaze steadily on him,” John Piper writes of Holy Week, “as he loves you to the uttermost.”\nThat one word—uttermost—is loaded with significance. Jesus willingly died for his friends and endured unimaginable degrees of suffering to do so (John 13:1). To love to the uttermost is to love freely, without reserve or limit, and without flaw or failure. Love to the uttermost is unquenchable, unstoppable, and resolute. As we watch his arrest and trial and death unfold for eight days, we gaze on a Christ who begrudges no pain or reproach on his pathway to redeem lost sinners. This is the man who “humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:8). This is love to the uttermost.\nAs the story of Christ’s death freshly hits our senses, we read of a Savior who exercises his own authority over death and promises to take up his own life in the end (John 10:18). “Anybody who makes a statement like that,” Piper writes, “is either mentally deranged, or lying, or God.” Everything is at stake in how we respond to those options. What are we to do with this Jesus who loves to the uttermost and tramples death?\nLove to the Uttermost is a devotional spanning from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday. It is comprised of eight excerpts (plus one prologue reading) selected from John Piper’s vast 32-year writing and preaching ministry at Bethlehem Baptist Church in the Twin Cities. This devotional can be used for personal, family, or group devotions. It can serve anyone who seeks a steadied gaze to watch our Savior as he loves us to the uttermost."

The issue hit newsstands and re-ignited a longstanding mommy war in American culture. We were ready to respond from a Christian perspective at desiringGod.org—but only barely.\nTen months earlier ( July 2011), when our blog was just beginning to take shape and we had no regular female contributors, writer and mother of six, Rachel Jankovic (Idaho), wrote and emailed a submission to us in a Word doc. We pasted it into a blog post, gave it a simple title—“Motherhood Is a Calling (And Where Your Children Rank)”—and hit publish. We simply posted the text and added no image, no color, no visual flair. Despite its minimalism, the post spread virally immediately, and the initial momentum swelled for months. A full three years later, the post has been ‘liked’ on Facebook over 100,000 times and viewed over 500,000 times, both records for anything published on the Desiring God blog. The post now averages 180 visits every day.\nRachel’s post awoke us to the segment of DG blog readers who are wives and mothers eager to apply the gospel to their hearts and homes. Sensing the need, in February of 2012 I wrote in my journal a short prayer: “We need more ‘mommy bloggers’ who can write, who have time to write, and, most importantly, who understand the gospel, joy, and Christian Hedonism, and who are skilled to apply all this to their own hearts in the context of the home and the pressures of motherhood.” It was a prayer echoed verbally many times by the content team here at DG. In the meantime, Rachel was kind enough to continue writing for us. As a team we began reading mommy blogs, gathering leads, and sending requests.\nIn March 2012, we received our first posts from Rachel Pieh Jones (Djibouti) and Christine Hoover (Virginia). The next month we added to the mix Gloria Furman (Dubai) and Trillia Newbell (Tennessee). In June we published a post from Rebekah Merkle (Idaho). In 2013 we began receiving posts from Christina Fox (Florida) and Stacy Reaoch (Pennsylvania).\nWithout intending it, this geographically diverse group of women created a unique, global perspective on biblical femininity. Spread across the country and across the world, these ladies shared one calling: seeking to live fruitfully and faithfully as daughters of God, wives, and moms.\nThe two-year span between March 2012 and March 2014 brackets a golden age of blog publishing for us. These writers combined to publish 89 posts, mostly under the banner: “Grace at Home.” They addressed themes like the mother’s struggle with anxiety, the crucial value of prayer, treasuring children, the challenges of perfectionism, the lies of feminism, the loss of promising careers, dependence on God, and the ugly pride behind mommy wars.\nChristian mothers today find themselves pitched in a battle that will not end until Christ returns, so DG’s female contributors continue to play an essential role in our online voice. But we have found a place more naturally integrated into the overall flow of our content. This spring we retired the “Grace at Home” label, and now look back on it as a banner over God’s overwhelmingly gracious answer to our prayers.\nMom Enough is a compilation of the most popular pieces from this golden age, here published in chronological order. As you will see, the aim of Mom Enough is not to boost a mother’s self-sufficiency, but to build her fearlessness as she finds her sufficiency outside of herself (1 Pet. 3:1–6). This paradox is the secret power of godly mothers. Becoming mom enough comes as a result of answering the question, “Are you mom enough?,” with a firm no.\nWe begin with the blog post from Rachel Jankovic that started it all."

This is the starting place for any serious topical focus: to have the view of his greatness before us and to be swallowed up by it. The LORD — the triune God whose essence we can't divide and whose persons we can't blend. He is utterly independent, gloriously sovereign, never arbitrary. This is precisely the reason we exist, that we might enjoy him, to his glory. And that’s why sanctification matters.\nGod has designed that the salvation of his people not only involve his unconditional election and Jesus's redemptive triumph, but also the perfecting work of his Spirit — a work that seeps down into the nitty-gritty of our lives and wields the gospel's victory one swing at a time.\nThis is high-voltage power we're talking about. Power that we find in looking back and in looking forward. John Piper writes, \"The only sin that we can defeat is a forgiven sin.\" A forgiven sin is something we see in light of the cross (past event) where Jesus bore the wrath we deserved and kicked the teeth out of our guilt. This fuels the sin- conquering power needed now, in the present. But we also look forward, to the future. The past work of Christ secures the life and joy of our future with Christ. It's set. Done. And this also fuels the power needed now, in the present. Piper writes, \"Sin can't enslave a person who is utterly confident and sure and hope-filled in the infinite happiness of life with Christ in the future.\"\nIn God's wisdom, he spans every tense: the past work of Jesus outside of us and the future promise of Jesus for us collide in the present to empower our wills to kill sin. To grow in grace. To be sanctified. This e-book includes three sermons by Pastor John Piper that get at the heart of this in such texts as Philippians 2:12–13 and Romans 6:5–10. There is also a more practical appendix of some acronyms that Pastor John has taught over his 30-plus-year preaching ministry. Whether fighting a specific sin or walking by faith amid stressful circumstances, the aim of this e-book is to add to your arsenal for the everyday work of sanctification, for the glory of God."

The theme is “Brothers, We Are Still Not Professionals: Reclaiming the Centrality of the Supernatural in Ministry.” Just days prior to the conference is the scheduled release of John Piper’s revised and expanded book Brothers, We Are Not Professionals: A Plea to Pastors for Radical Ministry.\nThis short ebook is a celebration and extension of that book—born not only from an effort to whet the appetite for the coming conference, but in a hope to bless pastors and other Christian leaders beyond the book and conference.\nIn October 2012, Desiring God issued invitations to a handful of ministry friends—all of them seasoned pastors whom we deeply respect—to contribute to this ebook. As the chapters came in, we posted them at the Desiring God blog; now that they’ve all arrived, we are publishing them together in one place as a resource we hope might have a long electronic shelf life.\nWe asked the contributors to express in these chapters their “heart of hearts” for fellow pastors—what comes to their minds first, or most profoundly, when they think about influencing fellow ministers. Given their unique involvements and contexts, what one thing would they want other pastors to hear?\nWe readily admit that the experiences and perspectives of our group are limited—the group is made up entirely of pastors in 21st-century North American contexts. However, we believe that the substance of these chapters taps into profound human themes, in both the pastor and his flock, and will be of use for Christian leaders far beyond our limited North American context. This is our prayer.\nOne more thing to address in this preface: why this ebook is addressed to “brothers” and not to “sisters.” Here’s how John Piper addresses that question in the preface of his Brothers book:\nTo those who want me to write for “brothers and sisters,” I say, let everyone be fully convinced in his own mind. As for me, the biblical teaching is clear: God calls spiritual, humble, Christlike men to lead the family as husbands and to lead the church as elders (Ephesians 5:20–33; 1 Timothy 2:12–13). I believe, and I have experienced for thirty years, that godly, gifted, articulate, intelligent, ministering women flourish in such families and churches.\nWe, too, in addressing this ebook to the “brothers,” believe that it is not at the expense of our wonderful sisters, but for the sake of their undiminished thriving. We believe that as Christian men step forward to fulfill their callings as Christlike men in the family and the local church, Christian women will flourish."

Skillful listening is a non-negotiable skill for everyone who enters a church building on Sunday or plays a sermon through headphones during the week. \n\nThe life and health and growth of our souls are tied to how well we listen. We are wise to periodically evaluate our own hearing of God’s word. If we listen with carelessness, we can drift away from God. On the other hand, if we listen with vigilance we “swim against the stream of sin and indifference.” \n\n\n“Don’t be cavalier in the hearing of God’s Word week after week,” John Piper cautions us. “If it is not softening and saving and healing and bearing fruit, it is probably hardening and blinding and dulling.” It is too easy to slip into what Scripture calls “dullness of hearing,” to hear the weekly sermons without faith, and to see little or no moral fruit in our lives as a result. As Jesus makes clear, ultimately it is how we hear that reveals who we are (John 8:43, 47, 10:4, 27). \n\n\nThose are a few of the points made in this e-book, which is comprised of five unedited sermon manuscripts from the preaching ministry of Pastor John Piper at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This selection covers a span of fourteen years (the earliest sermon was taken from 1984, the latest from 1998). The five selected manuscripts are published here as they existed when the sermons were preached. There is little doubt that Pastor John would prefer to rework these manuscripts stylistically and even structurally in a number of ways to make them more suitable for reading. Yet we believe these sermon manuscripts in their present state of development are sufficiently clear to benefit our readership now. Where explanation is necessary, footnotes have been added. We pray this resource will serve your personal reflection as you heed Jesus’ command to “take care how you listen.”"

Therefore, the goal of spiritual leadership is that people come to know God and to glorify him in all that they do. Spiritual leadership is aimed not so much at directing people as it is at changing people.\nIf we would be the kind of leaders we ought to be, we must make it our aim to develop persons rather than dictate plans. You can get people to do what you want, but if they don’t change in their heart, you have not led them spiritually. You have not taken them to where God wants them to be.\nEveryone has the responsibility of leadership in some relationships. But my concern in this short ebook is with the characteristics that a person must have in order to be a spiritual leader who excels both in the quality of his direction and the numbers of people who follow him.\nBiblical spiritual leadership contains an inner circle and an outer circle. The inner circle of spiritual leadership is that sequence of events in the human soul that must happen if anyone is to take the first step in spiritual leadership. These are the absolute bare essentials. They are things that all Christians must attain in some degree, and when they are attained with high fervor and deep conviction they very often lead one into strong leadership. In the outer circle are qualities that characterize both spiritual and non-spiritual leaders."

For more than two centuries after its first publication, The Pilgrim’s Progress ranked just behind the King James Bible as the most important book in evangelical Protestant households. The book has been translated into some two hundred languages, including eighty in Africa. Any book that has achieved such popularity has a very large claim to our attention.\nFACTS OF PUBLICATION\nThe Pilgrim’s Progress actually has two publication dates, corresponding to the two books that comprise it. The first book was published in 1678 and bore the title The Pilgrim’s Progress: From This World to That Which Is to Come, Delivered Under the Similitude of a Dream. It tells the story of the spiritual journey of the protagonist named Christian from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City (meaning heaven).\nBook II was published six years later as part of an old artistic tradition known as a “companion piece.” It tells the story of the same journey, this time undertaken by Christian’s wife, Christiana, and their four sons. The two books continued to be published separately until 1728, not being published as a combined book until forty-four years after the first appearance of Book II. This new edition from Desiring God resembles the early publication strategy of The Pilgrim’s Progress by releasing Book I individually.\nAdditionally, in order to provide more insight into the life of Bunyan, this new edition features an introduction by John Piper that traces the character of Bunyan’s faith in the midst of suffering. This new edition also includes a preface written by John Newton in 1776. Newton’s preface accompanied several publications of The Pilgrim’s Progress in the eighteenth century, but has virtually been non-existent for the last century. The recovery of this preface and incorporation into the present volume sets it apart from other editions currently in print."

It will be his supreme delight to fear Yahweh – that is, to enter into that relation of absolute dependence on Yahweh which receives reciprocally a fellowship with Yahweh, sharing together in love and united purposes”.

Prayer may thus be defined as: the mutual articulated communication between God and man. It is mutual, that is, it is a two way affair. It is articulated for it involves speech. It is a communication in that it is related to the purposes and processes of thought, feeling, and will of persons. It is to be seen not in the area of the magical but in the area of person-to-person communication. The possibility of communication lies in the fact that God is personal. It is not talk about nothing but a communication or sharing of oneself. It is a two-way conversation involving sharing at every level. Prayer is always self-communicating. Prayer is an essential part of worship by both individuals and groupings. The divine purpose in creating man had two sides : personal fellowship and divine programme. God was to rule the world through man (Gen 1.28, Heb 2.8).- men united to God finally through the Indwelling Spirit (Jn 14.23, 2 Cor 3.17). Worship is a person – centred experience and so involves the whole man - Deut 6.5, Mt 22. 37- physical strength, psyche, mind, heart. In worship man’s knowledge about God must become knowledge of God – intimate mutual sharing."

In truth, since you alone are everywhere considered as being the cause of my engaging in war, I cannot at any time fail to remember you; and although I have been compelled by the causeless raging of your impious flatterers against me to appeal from your seat to a future council—fearless of the futile decrees of your predecessors Pius and Julius, who in their foolish tyranny prohibited such an action—yet I have never been so alienated in feeling from your Blessedness as not to have sought with all my might, in diligent prayer and crying to God, all the best gifts for you and for your see. But those who have hitherto endeavoured to terrify me with the majesty of your name and authority, I have begun quite to despise and triumph over. One thing I see remaining which I cannot despise, and this has been the reason of my writing anew to your Blessedness: namely, that I find that blame is cast on me, and that it is imputed to me as a great offence, that in my rashness I am judged to have spared not even your person."
